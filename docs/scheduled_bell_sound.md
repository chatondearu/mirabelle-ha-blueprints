## Prerequisites

- A compatible media player (media_player)

### Optional Parameters

- **Announce Volume Level**: Volume level for the announcement (0-1, default: 0.5)
- **Volume Reduction**: Volume reduction for the announcement (0-1, default: 0.2)
- **Wait Time**: Time to wait before restoring volume (1-300 seconds, default: 20)

### Setting Up Triggers

Before using the blueprint, you need to create the necessary helpers:

1. **Time Triggers**:
   - Create `input_datetime` helpers for each time you want to trigger the sound
   - Example: `input_datetime.morning_bell`, `input_datetime.evening_bell`

2. **Sun Triggers**:
   - Select from predefined sun events:
     - sunrise
     - sunset
     - dawn
     - dusk
     - noon
     - midnight
     - custom

3. **Custom Triggers**:
   - Define any Home Assistant trigger
   - Supports all trigger platforms (state, event, mqtt, etc.)

## Usage Examples

### School Bell with Time Triggers
```yaml
# First, create the helpers
input_datetime:
  morning_bell:
    name: "Morning Bell"
    has_date: false
    has_time: true
  break_bell:
    name: "Break Bell"
    has_date: false
    has_time: true

# Then use them in the blueprint
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: time
      at: !input time_triggers  # Will use all selected input_datetime entities
  action:
    - service: script.play_sound_with_volume_control
      data:
        media_player: media_player.living_room_speaker
        sound_file: media-source://media_source/local/sounds/school_bell.mp3
        announce_volume: 0.5
        volume_reduction: 0.2
        wait_time: 20
```

### Prayer Time with Sun Events
```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: sun
      event: !input sun_triggers  # Will use all selected sun events
  action:
    - service: script.play_sound_with_volume_control
      data:
        media_player: media_player.living_room_speaker
        sound_file: media-source://media_source/local/sounds/prayer.mp3
        announce_volume: 0.6
        volume_reduction: 0.3
        wait_time: 30
```

## Customization

1. **Triggers**: Configure any combination of supported trigger types
2. **Volume**: Adjust announcement volume and reduction
3. **Audio File**: Use any audio file from your library
4. **Wait Time**: Adjust time before volume restoration

## Troubleshooting

- Check if the media player is online
- Ensure the audio file exists in the specified path
- Verify that all required helpers are created
- Check if the `play_sound_with_volume_control` script is installed
- Adjust wait time if volume doesn't restore properly
- Check media_source folder permissions
